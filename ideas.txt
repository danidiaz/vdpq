Desired features:
    - queries and targets specified in a JSON file.
    - concurrent queries (but allow for throttling).
    - show progress report on stderr (this is important! there's nothing worse
      than the program hanging and not being able to know which query is the
      culprit).
    - clean handling of Ctrl-C (I handled this badly in the Python version)
    - allow pretty-printing of queries for human consumption.
    - list of queries is ordered, maybe not for execution but for display
      purposes.
    - allow for both ordered and unordered result sets.
    - allow displaying the concatenated list of results to stdout.
    - allow using external tool to diff query results. 

    - (later...) allow for different types of queries beyond REST queries.

Implicit parameters:
    - "plan.js" in the current folder. --plan option for other folders.
    - for comparison operations, the "baseline" folder is used, but there
      should be an option to change it with --baseline.
    
Possible commands
    - vdqp example 
        - writes and example plan file to stdout
    - vdpq query destfolder
        - perform a query run and write the results to destfolder   
    - vdpq report folder
        - summarize the results of a query run, showing failed queries in
          particular.
    - vdpq cat folder
    - vdqp collate folder --baseline baseline
    - vdpq diff folder queryname --baseline baseline
        - diff with external tool
    - vdpq pretty --plan someotherplanfile
